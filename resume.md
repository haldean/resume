- GPA of 3.66, completed 122 of 124 credits
- Dean's List 6 semesters (Fall 2008 -- Fall 2011)

## Professional Experience ##

### Columbia Computer Graphics Group
New York, NY  
Undergraduate Researcher  
January 2012 -- May 2012  

- Working with Yotam Gingold, advised by Eitan Grinspun.
- Created [Annotate23D](https://github.com/haldean/annotate23d), an iPad app for
  human-friendly 3D modelling using sketches and annotations.

### Computer Science Department, Columbia University ###
New York, NY  
Teaching Assistant  
January 2011 -- December 2011  

- Teaching assistant for Computer Science Theory, Spring 2011
- Teaching assistant for Programming in Matlab, Fall 2011

### University Events Management, Columbia University ###
New York, NY  
Sound and Light Theater Technician  
May 2009 -- present  

- Light and sound design for up to 6 events per week, working directly
  with clients to determine specifications, them implementing those
  specifications in a very constrained time frame.

### Google, Inc. ###
New York, NY  
Software Engineering Intern  
May 2011 -- August 2011  

- Returned to the DoubleClick Reporting team.
- Implemented two major features -- one involving massively parallel data
  processing in a MapReduce-type framework, and one involving writing custom
  HTTP services to export spreadsheets and other reports. Both involved
  front-end UI changes as well.
- Worked in Java and Python.
- Handled 13 bugs, including one P1 production bug.
- Contributed to code quality in the reporting midtier by taking on two large
  refactoring efforts.

### Google, Inc. ###
New York, NY  
Software Engineering Intern  
May 2010 -- August 2010  

- Worked with the DoubleClick Reporting team on front end and back end software
  in Java.
- Assisted in designing a new user interface for the DoubleClick Reporting
  module that included interactive graphs and reduced user interface latency by
  50 to 90 percent, then implemented this interface and launched it to a set of
  beta users.

## Recent Projects ##

Code for all personal projects is available
[on my Github account](https://github.com/haldean). The projects referenced
below represent recent projects, or projects that I think are of particular
note.

### C Virtual Machine
New York, NY  
Personal Project  
December 2011 -- present  
[Github Page](https://github.com/haldean/cvm)

- Created a virtual machine in pure C capable of parsing and executing a very
  basic bytecode scheme.
- Created a compiler in Python which compiles C to an intermediate
  representation of basic instructions, and then translates this IR to the
  bytecode of the virtual machine.
- Still very much in development, but notable acheivements include function
  calling and dynamically allocating memory. Support for floating-point math and
  an implementation of a subset of libc are currently in progress.

### sim3d
New York, NY  
Personal Project  
November 2011 -- December 2012  
[Github Page](https://github.com/haldean/sim3d)

- Created a three-dimensional physics simulator in C++ capable of simulating
  gravity forces, spring forces, vortex forces and drag forces between spheres.
- Includes explicit, semi-implicit and linearized implicit numerical
  integrators.
- Capable of efficiently simulating large multi-body gravitational systems.

### ArtRay
New York, NY  
Personal Project  
September 2011 -- November 2012  
[Github Page](https://github.com/haldean/artray)

- Created a ray tracing renderer in Haskell which supports Phong lighting, ideal
  reflection, refraction with opacity control, soft shadows, anti-aliasing and
  depth of field.

### Robocopter Project ###
New York, NY  
Faculty-Advised Independent Project in Computer Science  
May 2010 -- present  
[Github Page](https://github.com/haldean/droidcopter)

- Worked on a two-person team to desgin, build and program
  a quadricopter capable of stable flight, based on the Android
  platform.

- Designed and printed the body of the helicopter using a Makerbot
  and parametric modelling software.

- Created a Java application for communicating with the helicopter,
  capable of receiving streaming video, displaying sensor data and
  sending flight commands.

- Wrote a paper ([available here online][robocop-paper]) detailing the
  architecture of our systen and the design of the hardware.

### Feynstein ###
New York, NY  
Systems Integrator and Language Designer  
January 2011 -- May 2011  
[Github Page](https://github.com/haldean/feynstein)

- Worked on a five-person team advised by Professor Alfred Aho to design and
  implement a programming language for my Programming Languages and Translators
  course.
- Created the Feynstein programming language for complex 3D physics simulations.
- Language compiles down to Java, which then uses a standard library written by
  my team to perform highly accurate physical simulation.
- Featured in Professor Aho's showcase of distinctive languages from the course.
