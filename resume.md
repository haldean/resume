  parallel data processing in a MapReduce-type framework, and one involving
  writing custom HTTP services to export spreadsheets and other reports. Both
  involved front-end UI changes as well.
- First internship: assisted in designing a new user interface for the
  DoubleClick Reporting module that included interactive graphs and reduced user
  interface latency by 50 to 90 percent, then implemented this interface and
  launched it to a set of beta users.
