== Professional Experience ==

-- Google, Inc. --
New York, NY
Software Engineering Intern
May 2011 -- August 2011

- Returned to the DoubleClick Reporting team
- Implemented an Excel exporter for reports. This was completed ahead of
  schedule, has been released to a set of beta publishers, with a wide release
  to follow.
- Implemented per-publisher Bigtable disk quotas for saved reports. Disk usage
  is cached in Bigtable and is updated incrementally, with a Flume job to
  periodically invalidate the cache and recalculate usage values. Users can track
  their usage through the reporting UI using a widget I created.
- Wrote integration tests for the disk quota system to ensure the interaction
  between multiple backend services does not cause any interruption in report
  generation
- Used Google technologies including Bigtable, FlumeJava, the Google Web Toolkit
  and the Guice dependency injection framework
- Handled 13 bugs, including one P1 production bug
- Contributed to code quality in the reporting midtier by taking on two large
  refactoring efforts.

-- University Events Management, Columbia University --
New York, NY
Sound and Light Theater Technician
May 2009 -- present

- Light and sound design for up to 6 events per week, working directly
  with clients to determine specifications, them implementing those
  specifications in a very constrained time frame

Software Engineering Intern
May 2010 -- August 2010

- Worked with the DoubleClick Reporting team
  on front end and back end software in Java

  Reporting module that included interactive graphs and reduced
  user interface latency by 50 to 90 percent, then implemented this
  interface and launched it to a set of beta users
- My changes were launched to all users after I finished my internship

-- Robocopter Project --
New York, NY
Faculty-Advised Independent Project in Computer Science
May 2010 -- present

- Worked on a two-person team to desgin, build and program
  a quadricopter capable of stable flight, based on the Android
  platform

- Designed and printed the body of the helicopter using a Makerbot
  and parametric modelling software

- Created a Java application for communicating with the helicopter,
  capable of receiving streaming video, displaying sensor data and
  sending flight commands

- Wrote a paper detailing the architecture of our systen and the
  design of the hardware, which can be found at @https://github.com/haldean/droidcopter/raw/master/text/spring/essay-spring.pdf@

-- Lispy --
New York, NY
Personal Project
June 2011

- Wrote a Python parser for a simple Lisp using Ply (a Python implementation of Yacc)
- Capable of many basic Common Lisp idioms, such as cond, prog, function
  definitions, lists, let statements as well as some unusual capabilities for
  Common Lisp, including lazy evaluation and the ability to call Python code and
  import Python modules

-- Resume Generator --
New York, NY
Personal Project
July 2011

- Designed a text markup language for succinctly representing a resume
- Wrote a Python parser for this language, which then compiles it to LaTeX, HTML and Markdown

-- Feynstein --

Systems Integrator and Language Designer
January 2011 -- May 2011

- Worked on a five-person team advised by Professor Alfred Aho to design and implement a
  programming language for my Programming Languages and Translators course
- Created the Feynstein programming language for complex 3D physics simulations
- Language compiles down to Java, which then uses a standard library written by
  my team to perform highly accurate physical simulation
- Featured in Professor Aho's showcase of distinctive languages from the course
